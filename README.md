# midPoint_container

Eventually here will be a dockerized version of midPoint suitable for the use within TIER environment.

Currently there are some prototypes (concepts) of meeting TIER requirements, e.g.

* logging,
* MariaDB repository integration,
* passing sensitive information as secrets,
* and so on.

More comprehensive configurations will follow.
