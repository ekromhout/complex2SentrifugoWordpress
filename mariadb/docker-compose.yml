#
#  Composition of midPoint and TIER MariaDB containers.
#
#  MariaDB serves as a repository for midPoint.
#
#  Features:
#   - a separate volume for repository data (MySQL database directory), so it persists between creation/removal cycle of this stack
#   - a separate volume for midPoint home directory, containing config.xml, logs, generated encryption keys, and so on
